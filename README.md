HTML (Structure of the Quiz App)
The HTML file defines the structure of the quiz. It contains a <div class="app"> that wraps all elements. Inside this, a <h1> displays the title "Simple Quiz". A <div class="quiz"> contains a <h2> element with id="question" to display the current question. Below that, a <div id="answer-buttons"> holds four <button class="btn"> elements for the answer choices. There is also a <button id="next-btn">Next</button> to move to the next question. The external CSS (style.css) is linked for styling, and a JavaScript file (script.js) is included at the bottom to handle quiz logic.

JavaScript (Quiz Functionality)
The JavaScript file (script.js) controls the quiz logic. A questions array stores multiple objects, each containing a question string and an answers array with four possible answers. Each answer object has a text value and a correct boolean to indicate whether it is the correct choice. The quiz starts with startQuiz() that initializes the score and calls showQuestion(). This function updates the displayed question and dynamically creates answer buttons. When an answer is clicked, selectAnswer() checks if it's correct, highlights the correct answer in green (correct class), and incorrect ones in red (incorrect class). It also disables further clicks and displays the "Next" button. The handleNextButton() function moves to the next question or displays the final score when all questions are answered. If the user completes the quiz, showScore() displays the score and allows restarting the quiz.

CSS (Styling the Quiz)
The CSS file (style.css) provides styling for the quiz interface. The body background is set to lightskyblue, and the quiz box (.app) is centered with a white background, rounded corners, and padding. The question and answer buttons have custom styling, including hover effects. The correct answer is highlighted in green (.correct), while incorrect answers appear in red (.incorrect). The "Next" button (#next-btn) is styled with a dark blue background and appears only when an answer is selected.
